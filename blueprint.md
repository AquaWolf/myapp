# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a Flutter application that serves as a TrainAI Assistant. It will provide features like live train status, delay information, and a chat interface to interact with a database expert AI. The UI is designed based on a Stitch project, starting with a welcome screen.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Initial Version

*   **Welcome Screen:** The initial screen of the application.
    *   **Design:** Dark theme with a blue accent color. The font used is Space Grotesk.
    *   **Content:**
        *   A main title "Welcome to TrainAI Assistant".
        *   A subtitle "Your AI-powered train assistant, providing real-time status, delays, and more."
        *   A "Get Started" button.
*   **Theme:**
    *   **Color Scheme:** Dark mode with a primary color of deep purple and a seed color of `#135bec`.
    *   **Typography:** Using `google_fonts` with "Space Grotesk" for a modern look.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `google_fonts`: For custom fonts.
    *   `provider`: For state management (initially for theme toggling).

## Current Plan

*   Implement the "Welcome Screen" from the Stitch project.
*   Set up the basic Flutter application structure with a dark theme and custom font.
*   Modify the initial `main.dart` to display the new welcome screen.
